        "The Bellevue Almshouse was part of New York City's public health system, a place where poor, sick, homeless, and otherwise marginalized people were sent — sometimes voluntarily and sometimes forcibly.

As Shrout argues in [her essay](https://crdh.rrchnm.org/essays/v01-10-(re)-humanizing-data/), this data purposely reduced people to bodies and \"easily quantifiable aspects\" in order to devalue their lives, potentially enacting \"both epistemic and physical violence\" on them.\n",

How and why was this data collected? What assumptions are present in this data? What are the consequences of this data in the world? What does this data reflect about the world? For example, Shrout claims that the \"Bellevue administrators framed any ailments or difficulties inmates might have had as a consequence of [their immigration] status\" — perhaps best exemplified by the fact that a frequent \"disease\" in the dataset is \"recent emigrant.\" Below we're going to explore the prevalence of \"recent emigrant\" in the data as well as other salient patterns.\n",
