14487,The Museum Caught in a Maelstrom of Narratives: Exhibiting Islam in Europe,"It is not hard to argue that the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent horrific violent acts that have been carried out in the name of Islam in cities like, for example, Madrid, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Nice or Stockholm have all had a serious impact on public perceptions of Islam and Muslims in the West. One way of understanding the outcome of these processes is to argue that they have contributed to and produced and strengthened what Riem Spielhaus and I call narratives of inclusion and exclusion (Larsson and Spielhaus 2013, 2017). In this article I will use narratives of inclusion and exclusion as a backdrop and heuristic tool for analysing and discussing the impacts of these two grand ideal-type narratives on museums planning to display so-called Islamic artefacts.",Göran,Larsson,,SE,University of Gothenburg,goran.larsson@religion.gu.se,,"Göran Larsson, Professor of Religious Studies, University of Gotenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,Europe; contemporary; Museums; Historical inquiry,,,"BP, NX, AM",text,Religious Studies,"Islam, museums, narratives of inclusion and exclusion, Islamic arts, Europe",Swedish Research Council,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14487,10.1558/bsor.37651,2019-11-19 13:23:34,2019-11-19 14:23:16,Ailsa,Parkin,,aparkin@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,
14489,On Theology in the Academy,"Recently, theology has garnered renewed attention in the academy. For various reasons, both theologians and some religious studies scholars have argued that theology deserves to be brought into greater dialogue with other disciplines, and some have even argued that theology ought to be taught in the public university. There are interesting arguments to be made that theology is more similar to other disciplines than might initially be supposed, and even that it is at the cutting edge of certain recent developments in scholarship more broadly. There are also, however, noteworthy barriers to incorporating theology more fully into the academy, and these may present significant challenges to inter-disciplinary dialogue and the possibility of productive exchange between theology and other areas of research.",Jason,Blum,,US,Davidson College,jablum@davidson.edu,,"Jason N.

While some blame geographers for their insularity and incoherence, my central argument is that the focus of geographers on ontological questions has led geographies of religion to wax more theologically, producing an obstacle to dialogue with religious studies.

14516,"(Re)writing, (Re)righting, (Re)riteing Hupa Womanhood: Cutcha Risling Baldy and The Flower Dance Revitalization","In We Are Dancing For You, Risling Baldy explores the meaning and process of the revival of the Ch'ilwa:l, the Flower Dance, a coming-of-age ceremony for women of her tribe. The text opens with an epigraph from Lois Risling, a Hupa medicine woman and the author's mother, ""The Flower Dance is a dance that I wish all young women could have. . . .[This dance] does heal. That kind of intensive trauma where women have been abused and mutilated both spiritually and emotionally and physically."" (ix). These words offer a sense of what is at stake in this text. As Risling Baldy explains, Native women in what is now known as California were targets of strategic attacks of genocide by settler colonial governments through rape, murder, missionization, boarding schools, and assimilation. Such attacks worked to erase Native women's leadership, power, and ceremonial traditions. We can see the legacy of similar acts of violence in the ongoing epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and two spirits across North America. This work is personal, too, as Risling Baldy is a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe in northern California.1 She reflects on her own relationship as scholar and participant of the revitalization of this dance. Risling Baldy's text is particularly interesting in the nuanced ways she links the revival of this ceremony to Hupa cosmology, feminist theory, critiques of menstrual ""taboos,"" embodiment, and decolonial futurity.",Abel,Gomez,,US,Syracuse University,abgomez@syr.edu,,"PhD Student, Department of Religion, Syracuse University.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,United States; California; scholarly; History; ethnography,,,California F856-870,text,"Native American Studies, Women's and Gender Studies, History, Anthropology","Native American, feminism, women's religion, California",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14516,10.1558/bsor.37432,2019-11-20 09:32:58,2019-11-20 09:47:47,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

14523,"“They Were Talking about Themselves”: Michael Altman, American Hinduism, and Critique from the Inside of Religious Studies","Michael Altman’s Heathen, Hindoo, Hindu offers a major contribution to the history of Hinduism in America, as it revises the standard “Transcendentalist-Theosophist-Vivekananda-1965” trajectory with a critical eye toward the nationalist and orientalist discourses of formative episodes from the Colonial era up to Chicago’s World Parliament (xvii). Altman’s genealogical approach presumes no essence or definition of ‘Hinduism,’ which both suits his source materials and serves his interest in classification quite well. Throughout this history, a rich set of examples shows how ‘hazy notions’ of Indian religion variously served as discursive foils and straw-men against white, Protestant American identity¬–from scathing missionary accounts of barbaric ‘Juggernaut’ worship (30), to the racial hierarchies in American geography schoolbooks (59), Thoreau’s Walden Pond as a River Ganges (86), and the Indian-derived, but not Hindu, ‘wisdom religion’ of the Theosophical Society (109). As Altman convincingly argues, when white, Protestant Americans talked about religion in India, “they were not really talking about religion in India. They were talking about themselves” (xxi), and thereby constituting their own racial, national, and religious identities (140).",Andrew,Kunze,,US,University of Chicago,kunze@uchicago.edu,,"Andrew Kunze, PhD candidate, Anthropology of Religion, University of Chicago Divinity School, Chicago, USA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,global; 1721–1893; scholarly; review,,,"Classification of Religions, BL350–385",text,"Religious Studies, American History, Hindu Studies","Michael Altman, Orientalism, Politics of Representation",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14523,10.1558/bsor.34692,2019-11-20 10:42:30,2019-11-20 11:02:11,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

In the context of globalization, indeed, space might become fluid and rhizoid, but it also can be mineralized by means of frontiers . Such an empirical context requires a revision of the commonly accepted models of culture and social change, and of religious dynamics. Religions are indeed logically affected by the changes in their material, social and symbolic environments, which are reshaped by the forces of globalization and of modernization. Yet, social scientists and scholars in religion have, however, put primary emphasis on the transformations observed in the moral, social and symbolic aspects of religion, but undoubtedly, new patterns in the spatial forms and dynamics of religion are profoundly changing our perspectives on these topics .",Lionel,Obadia,,FR,Université de Lyon,lionel.obadia@univ-lyon2.fr,,LARHRA UMR 5190 Université de Lyon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,global; contemporary; scholarly; survey article,,,"Philosophy psychology, History of Religion",text,"religious studies, Sociology, Anthropology","religion, space, emotion, temporality",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14528,10.1558/bsor.33656,2019-11-20 11:10:44,2019-11-20 11:52:23,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

14530,From Protestant Temple to Ancestral Ox Park: Ostentatious Travels and Practices of the Malagasy Protestant Movement Exorcists,"This article proposes to question the movements and the practices of groups of lay exorcists (mpiandry) of the Malagasy Protestant movement of Revival (fifohazana). These groups of a decade of exorcists dressed in white pastoral robes walk through urban neighborhoodsn from the treatment and prayer rooms located in the reception centers of the movement, and the hamlets or rural villages, to the patient's home to take care of. The performance of exorcists fits not only outside the institutional space, but also outside of temporality usually reserved for hunting demons. At the time of exorcism and the burning of magical-religious protection charms, religious takes center stage, and the residential area of the patient's family is temporaly infiltrate by mpiandry. Therefore, the emotions engendered take a more complex dimension that support or rejection of exorcists practices. Exorcists move and surround the hamlet, and religious interferes in the houses of the ancestral village, the court, cultivated land and the ox park (family representations of the Betsileo region and also the economic resources). The neighborhood (sometimes distant) approaches. The exorcists are moving away from their reasons for coming (the illness of a family member) to impose practices on religious territory of ancestor worship. Through this ethnographic case, we will seize religious events in the public space, and the confrontation of secular Protestantism practiced outside institution and ancestor worship.

14531,The Torero during the Franco Regime: A “Soldier-Monk” in the Arena?,"During the Franco regime between 1939 and 1975, when Spain was under the grip of an official national-catholic ideology whose keystones were the army and church, the torero was used as a vector for Francoist ideology. Courageous, full of national pride and a stout Christian, the torero seemed to incarnate all the virtues of the Spanish, elevated in the Francoist model into the glorified image of the “soldier-monk”. Little research has so far been conducted into parallels drawn between the torero and the “soldier-monk”. Drawing on the analysis of media documents from the Franco period, this paper sets out to address the following question. How does the correlation between the torero and the “soldier-monk” fit with the sad-faced, austere knight-like figure of the matador Manolete (1917-1947) during the 1940s? Within the bullring, spectators (aficionados) and toreros share in intense emotions and a boundless sense of religious devotion that bind them to life while passing close to death.",Justine,Guitard,,FR,"CRESEM, Université de Perpignan",justine.guitard@univ-perp.fr,,"CRESEM, Université de Perpignan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,Spain; Contemporary; scholarly; Historical inquiry,,,Pratical Theology; BV5070-5095,text,"Sociology, Hispanic Studies","Franco regime, Manolete, soldier-monk, arena","Justine Guitard, University of Perpignan, PhD, Department of Hispanic Studies",Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14531,10.1558/bsor.29900,2019-11-20 11:29:47,2019-11-20 11:52:25,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

14533,Urban Pareidolia: Fleeting but Hypermodern Signs of the Sacred?,"Urban settings have long been considered by scholars in religion as one of the main sites of the weakening of religion in the past decades, if not the main one. Indeed, according to the master narrative of modernity, urban life and the social and cultural mixing it implies, the quick transformations of traditional institutions that used to rule entire societies, changes in the frames and in the forms of social relationships, cultural intermingling and métissages, the diffusion of lay and rationalistic ideals in the urban populations, among many other factors, are supposed to have played a crucial role in what was labelled the “fading away” of ancient religious traditions, or at least, in the “withdrawal” of religion from the so-called “public sphere” and its relocation in a “private sphere” where it is now subject to individualization processes . But the context has dramatically changed in the recent years. Almost unexpectedly, urban settings have become the main site for the return of religion, and have revealed the other side of modernity: the revival of religious beliefs and practices that modern and industrialized societies, from North to South, from the West to the East, have witnessed, has mainly taken place in urban settings – although rural areas, for different reasons, have also been concerned by the “return of the sacred” (the reinvention of rural and remote “sacred sites”, the installation of many new religious movements in the countryside, in a dual location, half urban – half rural).",Lionel,Obadia,,FR,"LARHRA UMR 5190, University of Lyon",lionel.obadia@univ-lyon2.fr,,"LARHRA UMR 5190, University of Lyon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,global; contemporary; scholarly; ethnographic inquiry,,,"Philosophy psychology, History of Religion",text,"religious studies, sociology, anthropology","religion, psychology, perception",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14533,10.1558/bsor.33670,2019-11-20 11:48:42,2019-11-20 11:52:26,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

Drawing on the latter, among others, and recent studies concerning plants and various fungi, I argue for the inclusion of non-animal life within the discussion of the relationship between affect and religion.

The aim in not to purely analyse and critique Religious Affects: Animality, Evolution, and Power (2015), but rather to enter into an ‘animal dance’ with it. The discussion-dance seeks to contribute to the space deftly opened by Schaefer in which theoretical accounts of religious affect that exist ‘outside of language’ may be developed. Centrally, it asks: How do we perceive and represent the dance? Indeed, the case studies found in Religious Affects have already proffered a response to that question. This modest contribution aims to further explore how scholars may take account of elusive immateriality — forces, emotion, energy etc. — methodologically.

Wilson’s biophilia hypothesis, that humans have a genetically influenced emotional affiliation with life and life-like processes, for some time has invigorated a prominent strain of scholarship within religion and ecology that taps into the affective dimensions of our evolutionary histories. Our biophilic tendencies coupled with the awe, wonder, and reverence evoked by these religiously resonant cosmologies, they argue, provide occasions for cultivating ethical investments rooted in genetic kinship. However, much of this work that adopts biophilia assumes a “healthy” animal-other and rarely affiliates with the ill, disabled, and mutated creatures impacted by ecological degradation.

More importantly, this Islamophobic pig imagery, which often mischaracterizes or willfully misrepresents Muslim dietary restrictions, reveals that Islamophobic internet memes are not primarily aimed at Muslims nor are they first and foremost an expression of fear of Islam. Instead this Islamophobic rhetoric takes the form of an inside joke, affectively linking those who are “in” on the joke, uniting them in a jovial transgression of “politically correct"" norms. This form of Islamophobia might be better termed “Islamophobophilia,” since it marks some Americans as insiders and others as outsiders.

14547,Epistemologies of Trauma: Cognitive Insights for Narrative Construction as Ritual Performance,"Beginning with Cathy Caruth's post-structuralist approach in the early 1990's, the study of trauma, memory, and affect has seen significant growth across many academic disciplines. Recent postcolonial perspectives, however, criticize Caruth's trauma theory for its focus on individual melancholia, its Eurocentric assumptions, and its diminishment of discursive practice and ritual. This article considers the rapidly expanding field of trauma studies, including current neuroscientific and biological approaches, to clarify the depth and breadth of trauma's relation to memory inscription, cultural identity, and the embodied transmission of trauma. Using a comparative methodology to examine the seminal contributions of Ted Jennings to the field of ritual studies (Jennings 1982, 1987, 2014) that correspond with Judith Herman's three-stage narrative therapy process (Herman 1997), this essay suggests that Herman's method of narrative construction conveys unique, embodied knowledge that can be understood as ritual performance. Several case studies are put into conversation with Herman's trauma theory in the conclusion of this paper to illustrate possible correctives to the weaknesses inherent in Caruth's “unspeakability” school of trauma theory—correctives having implications for fields as wide-ranging as cultural history, anthropology, ritual studies, affect theory, collective memory, anthropology, and postcolonial approaches to the study of religion.",Tyler,Tully,,GB,"University of Oxford, Faculty of Theology & Religion",tyler.tully@theology.ox.ac.uk,,"Tyler M.

14557,"Food Matters: Tasting, Teaching, Theorizing Religion and Food","Each week in my religion and food course during Spring 2016, a student or I brought foods related to the religious group we were studying into the classroom for all to try. With the first dish they tasted, students asked, “So what makes this food ‘religious’?” This question formed the central theme throughout the semester as we wrestled with what religion is in the context of food and foodways: the network of material aspects (food itself; practices like growing, distributing, cooking, eating; sensory experiences such as taste) and conceptual aspects (ideas, meanings, metaphors, symbols, values such as taste) of food in a particular social/cultural group. The familiar and unfamiliar foods elicited visceral reactions from students. This essay argues that paying closer attention to religion as an independent interpretive category and especially to food itself, as a material agent eliciting powerful sensory effects that precede religious ideas and enable those ideas, provides an alternative to dependence on common food studies’ interpretive categories and on the Protestant-influenced focus on food as abstracted symbol or metaphor of ‘meaning.’",Martha,Finch,,US,Missouri State University,marthafinch@missouristate.edu,,Associate Professor Emerita of Religious Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,North America; USA; contemporary; Theory and method; pedagogy,,,Religious Life; BL624-629.5,text,"Religious Stage, Food Studies","religion and food, foodways, material culture, sensory culture, theory and method",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14557,10.1558/bsor.33088,2019-11-20 14:54:21,2019-11-20 15:22:49,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,
14558,Bread Beyond Borders: Food as a Lens Into Tweed's Theory of Religion,"In this article I rely on Tweed’s theory of religion as found in Crossing and Dwelling (2006) to inform my exploration of how transnational identities are negotiated through food. I show how food is an ideal lens through which to see Tweed’s theory at work on the ground, in the lives, and bodies, of transnational migrants. Focussing on the last five words of Tweed’s definition of religion, namely that religions “make homes and cross boundaries,” I address how food plays the same role that Tweed posits for religion in the processes of home making and boundary crossing. Using examples from my ethnographic fieldwork in Paris, France and Montréal, Canada I show how, for my informants, food (in place of religion in Tweed’s theory) designates “where they are from,” identifies “who they are with” and prescribes “how they move across” the various borders, both physical and psychological in their lives.",Rachel,Brown,,CA,University of Evansville,racheldianeb@gmail.com,,"Visiting Assistant Professor, University of Evansville, Indiana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,"Paris, France; Montreal, Canada; Contemporary; 2016; Algerian, Moroccan, Tunisian migrants; Interview; Participant Observation",,,BL624-629.5,text,"Religious Studies, Anthropology","Food, Transnationalism, Thomas Tweed, Muslim, Migration, France, Quebec","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, University of Victoria, Centre for Studies in Religion and Society",Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14558,10.1558/bsor.32260,2019-11-20 14:59:53,2019-11-20 15:22:50,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

From this relational perspective, the network position of the actors and the qualities of the ties between them are the „material“ a guru-centered movement is made of. Instead of searching for more and more characteristics of the actors to explain the phenomenon (e.g. the guru's rhetoric skills and theological virtuosity or the devotee's disappointment with more conventional forms of religion), this approach helps to see a distinctive pattern of social organization that both enables and restricts interaction.",Vanessa,Lange,,CH,University of Bern,lavanessalange@yahoo.com,,Center for Global Studies / Institute for the Science of Religion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,"India; Global; contemporary; Social Networks, Globalization, New Religious Movement; Interview-based; ego-centered networks",,,"HM1106-1171 Interpersonal relations.

One of the most prodigious scholars to work on religion and violence, Girard produced scholarship that has stimulated thousands of scholars for over forty years.

Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization, from 1985-1994 and had continued as Professor Emeritus of French Language, Literature, and Civilization. While there are scholars who support Girard’s work and see much of his work as a launching point for further work—and carry the reference as “Girardians” – there are notable critics who disagree with Girard, even his most foundational concepts. Regardless of their positions, the advocates and dissenters of Girardian theory evince René Girard’s widespread impact.

14592,"Criticism, Critique, and Crisis in Assessing the Work of René Girard","Perhaps it is time to begin the second stage of René Girard’s passing: the labor of a full critical assessment of his life’s work. In preparation, I thought I might consider some of the misunderstandings to which his work has been subject. After briefly recalling Girard’s three big ideas (mimetic desire, sacrificial violence and the scapegoat mechanism, scriptural revelation of the founding murder), I will suggest the most common misapprehensions: (1) the idea of the innocent victim; (2) the idea that there is a good and a bad mimesis; and (3) the relation between Girardianism and the ethical. Other issues remain to be clarified. Among them are the following ideas: (1) that Girardian thinking is scientific; (2) that it is not an advocacy of any kind but a way of producing knowledge; (3) that the center of gravity remains the process of sacrificial genesis and the scapegoat mechanism, mimetic desire, and their scriptural revelation serve that end; (4) that violence is not a thing or essence but difference gone wrong; and finally (5) that Girardian thinking is not an essentialism; it is not about what is “really” good, true, beautiful, or present but strategies of doing and acting.

14597,Whither Girard and Islam? Reflections on Text and Context,"Despite attempts to bring scholars of Islam into dialogue with Girard’s theories of mimetic desire, scapegoating, and religious sacrifice, the scholarship on this topic is still extremely limited. In this article, Avery first expands on Wolfgang Palaver’s assertion in his short piece on Girard and Islam for The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Violence that declares Islam as part of the Abrahamic revolution against sacrifice. Avery then offers two reasons for why Girardian theory has not gained more interest from scholars of Islam, addressing biblical parallels in the context of the Qur’an, and Islam’s seeming departure from a sacrificial paradigm. Avery offers Girard’s mimetic desire as the discrete portion of Girard’s theory that resonates with the nature of Islamic texts, and also avoids the possible pitfalls of colonizing Islam with Judaic or Christian presumptions.",Vanessa,Avery,,US,Sacred Heart University and Hartford Seminary,averyv@sacredheart.edu,,"Vanessa Avery holds a PhD from the University of Exeter, and is an Instructor of Religious Studies at Fairfield University and Hartford Seminary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,Literary Analysis; Islamic Studies,,,"BL1-150 Religion, BP1-253  Islam",text,"Religious Studies, Islamic Studies, Comparative Religion","Rene Girard, Islam, Qur'an, Mimetic Theory, Sacrifice",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14597,10.1558/bsor.v45i3-4.31361,2019-11-21 15:08:22,2019-11-21 16:04:55,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,
14602,"The Worm in the Pudding Cup: Violence, Disgust, and Mimetic Theory","Drawing on insights offered by Richard Beck in Unclean: Meditations on Purity, Hospitality, and Mortality (Beck 2011), I explore several categories of disgust. Girard incorporates sociomoral disgust into his theoretical reflections; however, core disgust and animal-reminder disgust are discrete forms of revulsion not recognized as such by Girard. Arguing that these merit special attention, I argue that Girard’s theory is made more compelling, not less, when we attend to foul elements that ooze from around the edges of his theory despite his effort to contain them under the sign of sacrifice. Making this seepage a topic of discussion is like taking the lid off a carton long forgotten at the back of the refrigerator.

On the whole, Girard’s theory of sacrifice is anachronistic for the Iliad, and the Iliad’s poetic characterizations, particularly of Achilles, defy the lack of interiority presumed by Girard’s mimetic theory.

Even if one questions, as I do, Girard’s idea that mimetic desire is the sole driving force behind symbols of religious violence, one can still agree that mimesis is a significant factor. One can also agree with the theme that Girard borrows from Freud, that the ritualized acting out of violent acts plays a role in displacing feelings of aggression, thereby allowing the world to be a more peaceful place in which to live. But the critical issue remains as to whether sacrifice should be regarded as the context for viewing all other forms of religious violence, as Girard and Freud have contended.",Mark,Juergensmeyer,,US,"University of California, Santa Barbara",juergens@global.ucsb.edu,,"Professor of Sociology and Global Studies, and founding director of the Orfalea Center for Global and International Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,global; contemporary; survey article,,,BL Comparative religion; theories of religion,text,"Religious Studies, Sociology, Political Science","religious violence, Rene Girard, cosmic war, terrorism",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14606,10.1558/bsor.v45i3-4.31351,2019-11-21 15:56:06,2019-11-21 16:04:57,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

14611,True Stories and the Poetics of Textual Discovery,"As we know from the Nag Hammadi saga, there is something enchanting about telling find stories. This enchantment is part of the very reason “getting the story straight” is so difficult when it comes to manuscript discoveries: every story worth its salt will be transformed in the telling, and stories that are alive are reactive. If one way to approach these stories is to debunk those aspects that are products of embellishment and myth, another is to attend precisely to their affective power, seeing them as a narrative genre in the longue durée. Using examples from both pre-modern find stories and narratives about the discovery of the Cairo Geniza and the Dead Sea Scrolls, this essay discusses what the find story genre can tell us about how we imagine our relationship with a fragmented past. True or legendary, such stories are always imaginative products.

Some Thoughts on Why and How We Define Things,"Caroline Schaffalitzky de Muckadell's 2014 article, ""On Essentialism and Real Definitions of Religion,"" offers a comprehensive rationale for the use of real, essentialist definitions of religion in the field of religious studies. In this article, I examine her arguments and the proposed definition she supplies. I argue that a close reading of Schaffalitzky's piece, concentrating especially on the way she uses examples, helps to demonstrate that she and her anti-essentialist opponents view the field of religious studies in incommensurable ways. While Schaffalitzky views definitions as serving the analytical study of religion as an object, her opponents view definitions primarily rhetorically and seek to focus attention on the process of defining.",Nathan,Rein,,US,Ursinus College,nrein@ursinus.edu,,"Nathan Rein is an Associate Professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Ursinus College, Collegeville, PA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,Global; USA; contemporary; critical analysis,,,BL350-385 Classification of religions,text,Religious Studies,"religion, definitions of religion, theory",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14638,10.1558/bsor.v44i4.27760,2019-11-22 13:38:15,2019-11-22 14:41:59,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

Focusing nearly entirely on the first half of her essay, in which she sets up an exclusive disjunction regarding three forms of definition, I argue that this disjunction should not be understood as exclusive and, hence, her account of the necessity of “real definitions” is less compelling than it might otherwise be. Even though I am sympathetic to the importance of striving toward real definitions, in response to Schaffalitzky de Muchadell, I resituate how such striving might look when the exclusive disjunction is abandoned.",J.

The principal as well as mayor Beth Van Duyne (who has previously appeared on Glenn Beck to discuss her fears over sharia law) have defended the actions of the school and police. But critics have speculated that neither the school nor police ever actually believed Mohamed had a bomb and that this was really a case of bigots humiliating a Muslim student under the pretense of public safety.

14738,Wasteland America: The United States in Premillennialist Apocalypse Scenarios,"One of the more perplexing exegetical difficulties faced by adherents of American-style premillennialism has to do with the question of what role the United States will play in the coming apocalypse. Despite the nearness of the eschaton and the critical role that the United States is often said to play in foreshadowing it, the Mediterranean-based apocalypse scenario that lies at the heart of most premillennialist exegesis seems to leave little room for a strong U.S. presence at the end. In this article, I shall first survey various premillennialist attempts to account for this quandry before turning to my main argument: that premillennialism's very failure to find the U.S. within the pages of prophecy invests the nation with chameleon-like agency, freeing it from the fatalism often implied in apocalyptic speculation – and creating the possibility of a new political theology conceptualized within in the shadow of the end.",Jesse,Hoover,,US,Baylor University,jesse_hoover@baylor.edu,http://baylor.academia.edu/JesseHoover,"Jesse A.

14748,Is Nessie a Naga? Buddhism in the West and Emerging Strategies of Importation,"In 2014 Lama Gelongma Zangmo of Scotland sparked curiosity when she suggested that the Loch Ness monster or “Nessie” is actually a naga––a fantastic creature from Buddhist mythology. Visitors to her Tibetan practice center on the shores of the Loch will be able to leave offerings to Nessie. Without exaggerating the significance of these offerings within the larger context of Zangmo’s practice, this article suggests that efforts to ritually incorporate Nessie into a Buddhist cosmology is an index of broader changes in Buddhism’s arrival to the West. First, Zangmo’s open discussion of cosmology, ritual, and supernatural beings is a marked distinction from “Protestantized” Western Buddhism, which has historically presented Buddhism as a rational and philosophical alternative to Christianity. This suggests that Buddhists in the West have become less concerned with conforming to Protestant notions of “proper” religion. Second, Zangmo’s praxis is significant to broader patterns of how Asian religions adapt to Western topography. Whereas Asian immigrants have sometimes re-imagined Asian sacred sites in Western countries, Zangmo was taken the opposite strategy of “Buddhicizing” a local monster. This suggests that similar transformative moves can be expected as a globalized world continues to transplant religious traditions from one continent to another.",Joseph,Laycock,,US,Texas State University,joe.laycock@gmail.com,,"Joseph Laycock is an assistant professor of religious studies at Texas State University.

14749,Atheism and the Invention of Religion: Notes on History and Anachronism,"A characteristic feature of the so-called ""new atheism"" is that it opposes itself not simply to Christianity, or even to theism, but to religion. One of its central contentions -- meant to deflate particularistic claims to uniqueness -- is that religion admits of a unified theory: though Christianity differs from Islam, say, both -- and indeed all tokens of the type -- are explicable in terms of the same basic mechanisms. Yet, this understanding of religion as a transcultural and transhistorical universal is a distinctively modern, Western one. This paper seeks to locate the emergence of the contemporary concept of “religion” partly in European philosophical and theological debates over the threat to Christianity perceived to be posed by secularization. Developing a line of thought advanced by Tomoko Masuzawa, I argue that the invention of “religion” (as a genus) and the “world religions” (as its species) in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, like the creation of deism in the seventeenth and eighteenth, served apologetic goals but also exposed the resulting formations to new forms of criticism. Whereas atheism is often said to be “negative,” in that it can be defined only by reference to what it rejects (and thus does not constitute a unitary viewpoint), I argue that “atheism” and “religion” are dialectically co-constituted categories, and that lines of influence continue to push in both directions. The distinction between “religion” and its other(s), I conclude, is better understood as emerging out of, rather than as the underlying cause of, ongoing debates about atheism.",Richard,Amesbury,,CH,University of Zurich,richard.amesbury@sozethik.uzh.ch,,"Richard Amesbury is Professor of Theological Ethics, Faculty of Theology, University of Zurich.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,Early Modern; Nineteenth Century; Contemporary; historical inquiry,,,BL1-50,text,"Religious Studies, Secular Studies","atheism, religion, deism, pluralism",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14749,10.1558/bsor.v43i4.40,2019-11-26 15:14:34,2019-11-26 15:22:27,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

The panelist argues that Kuhlman’s deft utilization of television, in particular, enabled her not only to control her own image but also to change the image of charismatic Christianity for postwar American audiences. In addition to crafting an image of herself and charismatic Christianity, Kuhlman also mastered the discourse of elision in order to subordinate her very visible, very feminine body. As a female religious leader, Kuhlman had to contend with the practice of self-negation expected by women in many conservative Christian groups in order to gain any significant degree of power. In other words, Kuhlman had to “disappear” or “die” in order to be a vessel for the Holy Spirit if she was to maintain authority. As an embodied female she could not lead without first subordinating, even denying, her own very visible body.",Amy,Artman,,US,Missouri State University,AmyArtman@MissouriState.Edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,United States; contemporary; panel article,,,"BL1-50 Religion (General), HQ1101-2030.7 Women",text,"Religious Studies, Sociology","Bodies on Display, Kathryn Kuhlman, gender, charismatic renewal movement",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14772,10.1558/bsor.v43i2.19,2019-11-27 10:40:41,2019-11-27 11:23:05,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

14776,What is Euhemerism? A Brief History of Research and Some Persisting Questions,"The third century BCE Greek writer Euhemerus of Messene composed a utopian travel narrative entitled Sacred Inscription where he articulated a theory, known as euhemerism, regarding the origin of religion. The theory maintained that all Olympian gods were deified prominent kings and later scholars made use of it as a justification of divine kingship in the Graeco-Roman world. Euhemerism managed to survive in the early Christian era as a theory that represents the falsity of the gods of the pagans. From a theory of myth to a theory of religion and from a less important element of Euhemerus’ utopian narrative to mere historiography, euhemerism has managed to preserve itself in scholarly discussions without the existence of a comprehensive examination of the theory from a religious studies perspective and the way it was used in later periods. Based on the various and divergent usages and applications of euhemerism both in historical studies and in theoretical discussions on religion, the question remains: What is euhemerism?",Nickolas,Roubekas,,GB,University of Aberdeen,n.roubekas@abdn.ac.uk,http://www.abdn.ac.uk/sdhp/people/profiles/n.roubekas,Teaching Fellow in Religious Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Greco-Roman Religions in Focus,en_US,Greece; Italy; Egypt; Hellenistic Period; Graeco-Roman World; Early Christianity; Survey article; Historical inquiry; History of research,,,"BL1-50, BL300-325, BL430, BL700-820, BL2700-2790",text,"Religious Studies, Ancient History, Anthropology","Euhemerism, Divine Kingship, Graeco-Roman World, Deification, Theory of Religion, Early Christianity",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14776,10.1558/bsor.v43i2.30,2019-11-27 11:01:05,2019-11-27 11:23:06,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,
14778,Responding to the Wendy Doniger Controversy: The Problems and Possibilities in the Academic Study of Religion,"The controversy over Penguin India withdrawing Wendy Doniger's book, announced in February 2014, provides an occasion to consider the problems and possibilities within the academic study of religion. As the controversy centered on representations of what both Doniger and her opponents termed Hinduism, the problems with adjudicating contested definitions of religions or the category religions becomes apparent. Rather than assuming that we can present a normative definition of any of these terms, I argue that scholars should avoid applying these contested labels themselves and recognize instead whose application of contested labels that they use.

14784,Rethinking “Religion and Politics”: Reflections on the Reception and Import of Talal Asad’s Genealogies of Religion,"Twenty years after the publication of Genealogies of Religion, scholarship in the field of “religion and politics” mostly ignores Talal Asad’s central arguments about the socially constructed nature of the secular-religious distinction. However, a critical counter-tradition is gaining traction. After briefly reviewing the work of three scholars who have drawn on Asad to intervene in debates in political theory, religion and violence, and international relations, I offer some reflections on the triangular relation among states, capital, and the cultural formation of religion. “Religion” as a transcultural category, I argue, can be understood as partly the spectral projection of a universalizing liberal-capitalist order in search of an “other” by means of which to legitimate itself.",Richard,Amesbury,,CH,University of Zurich,richard.amesbury@sozethik.uzh.ch,,Professor of Theological Ethics Faculty of Theology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,United States; contemporary; Assessment of Field,,,BL1-50,text,"Religious Studies, Religion and Politics, Ethics","Talal Asad, Genealogies of Religion, Religion and Politics, Sovereignty, Globalization",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14784,10.1558/bsor.v43i1.2,2019-11-27 11:45:05,2019-11-27 12:34:24,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

14804,A Cinematic Approach to Teaching the Synoptic Problem,"For ten years I taught an undergraduate Theology course called “Hollywood Jesus.” This essay is an outgrowth of that course, and is based on a research topic that I often had students explore in papers. Utilizing the first two miracles in the first three Hollywood Jesus movies (Cecil B. DeMille’s The King of Kings (1927), Nicholas Ray’s King of Kings (1961), and George Stevens’s The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) this essay argues that these three Hollywood Jesus films are nearly as closely intertwined as the Synoptic Gospels themselves. Viewing these films in conversation with each other can raise students’ awareness of how the Synoptic Gospels themselves might be inter-related, and how they might be reshaping their sources for changing circumstances. My thesis, in part, is that the changing location of the films’ miracle stories reveals an increasing movement in American culture towards a privatization of religious experience—one that moves from the public arena, to the home and “the church.” While the gospels themselves do not exhibit this same movement, nevertheless, careful attention to the different gospel texts reveals comparable socio-political and theological changes. For students, “seeing” the similarities and differences in the cinematic representations can turn into “believing” that similar strategies might be at work in ancient written texts like the gospels.",Jeffrey,Staley,,US,Independent Scholar,staleyjl@comcast.net,,Independent Scholar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Essay,en_US,United States; contemporary; historical studies; film studies,,,BS1-2970 The Bible,text,"Biblical Studies, Film Studies","Synoptic Gospels, Synoptic Problem, Jesus movies",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14804,10.1558/bsor.v42i4.37,2019-11-27 14:12:32,2019-11-27 14:13:53,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

14810,"Laughing Matters: ""Parody Religions"" and the Command to Compare","The term “parody religion” is used to describe movements that deliberately mimic the elements of established religions and are intentionally absurd. It is generally assumed that people create and participate in parody religions primarily for their own amusement. However, the participants of parody religions occasionally demand to be taken seriously by invoking the legal rights and privileges that Western democracies afford to traditional religions. This article examines two such cases involving The Neo-American Church and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. It is argued that the true function of parody religions, as demonstrated by these cases, is not simply to entertain, but to force a public conversation about the definition of religion. When practitioners of parody religions demand the legal rights afforded to traditional religion, they are issuing a public challenge to articulate how exactly religion is defined. Furthermore, ardent practitioners of parody religions frequently have a political agenda and feel that the legal system’s unstated criteria of religion unfairly benefit particular established religious institutions.",Joseph,Laycock,,US,Piedmont Virginia Community College,joe.laycock@gmail.com,http://people.bu.edu/jlay/,"Joseph Laycock is an adjunct professor at Piedmont Virginia Community College, USA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,United States of America; Belgium; contemporary; archival,,,"BL74-99 Religions of the world, HM(1)-1281 Sociology",text,"Religious Studies, Law, Sociology","parody religion, first amendment, Flying Spaghetti Monster, Neo-American Church",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14810,10.1558/bsor.v42i3.19,2019-11-27 15:11:21,2019-11-27 15:50:05,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,
14811,“I Needed to Go to this Tabernacle of Ignorance”: Marc Maron’s Critique of the Creation Museum,"On his 2011 comedy album This has to be funny, Marc Maron includes a routine in which he describes a visit to the Creation Museum, located in Petersburg, Kentucky just south of Cincinnati. Maron employs his typical combination of smart and angry wit as he satirizes the Museum and its agenda. This criticism takes the form of describing some of the Museum’s displays, and then reacting to them. The displays he spends the most time critiquing include the Garden of Eden room, animatronics of Old Testament figures, and the Noah’s Ark room. Bergson says that one source of laughter is seeing “the mechanical encrusted on the living” and this seems apt for understanding maron’s critique of displays such as these. Dogmatic religious believers can seem comical when their own beliefs interfere with their ability to adapt to new information—and this is exactly how the displays of the Creation Museum appear, thus making them targets for satire. Further, the museum, with its well documented and unscientific animatronics and dioramas (triceratops with saddles, tyrannosaurus rex eating a pineapple) creates its own dissonance when putting its ideas into sculptural forms. Museums often employ what Barbara Kirsehblatt-Gimblett has described as either in situ or in context display strategies, but both of these seem like empty, hyperreal rhetoric in the pseudoscientific position advocated by the museum.",Jerry,Jaffe,,US,Lake Erie College,jjaffe@lec.edu,,"Jerry C.

14828,Theoretical Challenges in Studying Religious Experience in Gnosticism: A Prolegomena for Social Analysis,"Several theoretical impediments face the ancient historian who wishes to embark on the study of religious experience within ancient cultures. While many of these difficulties face other religious studies scholars, the historical quality compounds these challenges. This paper explores several of these theoretical difficulties with a specific focus on the Valentinian, Sethian, and other so-called “Gnostic” groups in late antiquity. Specifically, the study of religious experience tends to give privileged interpretative position to insiders (evoking the etic/emic problem) and psychological analyses due to the “personal” or “individual” quality of such experiences (typified by perennialist approaches) (Otto, Wach, Eliade, Smart), or, following James and Jung, focus on the initial charismatic moment’s effect upon subsequent social structures. In contrast to such tendencies I suggest, by building on Fitzgerald’s lead in the Guide to the Study of Religion and largely agreeing with constructivist approaches, that we re-direct our focus toward the external social forces at play that discursively facilitate, shape, and direct experiential moments within the confines of social identity construction. This article builds on attachment theory from social psychology. Such analysis will allow us to better appreciate the experiential aspects of “Gnosticism” while appreciating the individual, communal, and (most importantly) discursive quality of the intersection of the individual and communal. Specific examples of such social facilitation will be briefly explored from Nag Hammadi, where ritual, narrative, and mythological discourse function to enable, and thereby define, religious experience.",Philip,Tite,,US,University of Washington,philip.tite@mail.mcgill.ca,http://independent.academia.edu/PhilipTite,"Philip L.

14829,The Philosophy of Religious Experience and the Nag Hammadi Texts: A Response to Kaler and Tite,"This essay, in response to Michael Kaler and Philip Tite, examines several theoretical issues about mystical experience in the Nag Hammadi texts. First is the problem of whether experiences can be an object of study at all, and I argue that they can, so long as we attend to the causes of the experiences. Attending to the causes of experiences, however, means that neo-perennialists must articulate and defend an account of the cause(s) of the cross-culturally universal experiences that they suppose occur. As for the attempt to apply contemporary psychologists' attachment theory to the experiential knowledge described in the Nag Hammadi texts, questions remain about the relation between attachment to the divine figure purportedly experienced and the experiencer's attachment to his or her religious community.",Stephen,Bush,,US,Brown University,stephen_bush@brown.edu,,Assistant Professor of Religious Studies Brown University.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,theory of religion; response article,,,"BL51-65 BL51-65 Philosophy of religion.

14830,Insights from Cognitive and Ritual Studies: A Response to Kaler’s and Tite’s Papers on Religious Experience in Nag Hammadi and Gnosticism,"Since the 1990s, scholarly debates and discussions in Gnostic or Nag Hammadi studies have largely revolved around the issues of whether the category of “Gnosticism” is helpful or detrimental in the analysis of ancient texts and how to classify the texts that were traditionally labeled “gnostic” as well as the groups that produced them. The debate about the category of “Gnosticism” in particular has brought up important issues concerning the ideological commitments of the scholars working on the Nag Hammadi texts and helped to analyze the identity formation process that shaped the history of the variety of early Christian groups during the first three centuries, but the debate has also somewhat exhausted itself. There is certainly room for new approaches and research questions. The panel on religious experience organized by the SBL Nag Hammadi and Gnosticism section and the two papers by Michael Kaler and Philip Tite presented in the panel and published in BSOR can be seen as welcome moves towards something new. Both papers share an interest in what might be called religious experience studies and therefore engage themselves in cross-disciplinary theoretical reflection and cross-fertilization between recent trends in religious studies and gnostic studies. This paper provides a critical response to these two papers with a particular emphasis on ritual and cognitive studies.",Risto,Uro,,FI,University of Helsinki,risto.uro@helsinki.fi,,"Lecturer of New Testament Studies, Faculty of Theology/Division of Biblical Studies, University of Helsinki.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,early Christianity; ritual studies; cognitive studies; response,,,"BV5070-5095 Mysticism, BR1-1725 Christianity, BS1901-2970 New Testament",text,"Biblical Studies, Religious Studies","religious experience, ritual studies, cognitive science of religion, Nag Hammadi",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14830,10.1558/bsor.v42i1.22,2019-11-28 11:20:10,2019-11-28 11:48:46,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

How is that some religious movements, labeled dangerous, produce evidence that cannot be trusted at face value? Why is there deep concern over the legitimacy of pop culture as a method to study religion? Relying upon Klan print and zombie culture, this article forces the issue of legitimacy and illegitimacy of evidence.",Kelly,Baker,,US,University of Tennessee,kbaker27@utk.edu,http://www.kellyjbaker.com,"Kelly J.

In this article I will follow Burton Mack's professional trajectory as he went from a member of the Bultmanian school to an iconoclast in New Testament studies. What I will show is that they key issue that Mack returns to again and again is the need for a theory of Religion in doing Biblical studies.

14859,More Christian Apocrypha,"Scholars interested in the Christian Apocrypha (CA) typically appeal to CA collections when in need of primary sources. But many of these collections limit themselves to material believed to have been written within the first to fourth centuries CE. As a result a large amount of non-canonical Christian texts important for the study of ancient and medieval Christianity have been neglected. The More Christian Apocrypha Project will address this neglect by providing a collection of new editions (some for the first time) of these texts for English readers. The project is inspired by the More Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Project headed by Richard Bauckham and Jim Davila from the University of Edinburgh. Like the MOTP, the MCAP is envisioned as a supplement to an earlier collection of texts—in this case J. K. Elliott’s The Apocryphal New Testament (Oxford 1991), the most recent English-language CA collection (but now almost two decades old). The texts to be included are either absent in Elliott or require significant revision. Many of the texts have scarcely been examined in over a century and are in dire need of new examination. One of the goals of the project is to spotlight the abilities and achievements of English (i.e., British and North American) scholars of the CA, so that English readers have access to material that has achieved some exposure in French, German, and Italian collections.",Tony,Burke,,CA,York University,tburke@yorku.ca,,"Associate Professor, Department of Humanities, York University, Canada.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,Near and Middle East; Europe; Syria; antiquity; historical and literary analysis,,,BS2830-2970 New Testament Apocrypha,text,"Religious Studies, Patristics, Medieval History","Apocrypha, good thief, Book of the Rolls, Infancy Gospel of Thomas, dialogue of the Paralytic with Christ, Life of John the Baptist, Serapion, Letter from Heaven, canon",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14859,10.1558/bsor.v41i3.16,2019-11-28 15:14:47,2019-11-28 16:10:37,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

Now Muslims are being criticized for being hyper-puritanical/patriarchal and sexually repressive; a topos that stands in stark contrast to the topos of sexual licentiousness promulgated in Orientalist discourses (including the visual arts).

Perceiving themselves as front fighters protected by the Archangel, Legionaries endeavour to purify the nation so that it can live in its God-given fatherland. In order to assure national resurrection, Legionaries want to create a “New Man”, understood as a new male. This ideal combines the qualities of a Christian martyr, a working hero, a monk and a militant and as such both complex and ambiguous. In practice, Legionaries have a lot in common with other European “boot boys”.

14908,Christus Virgo: Representations of Christ as a Virgin in Early Christianity and Late Antiquity,"The description of Christ as a virgin, 'Christus virgo', does occur at rare occasions in Early Christian and late antique texts. Considering that 'virgo' was a term that most commonly described the sexual and moral status of a member of the female sex, such representations of Christ as a virgin may exemplify some of the complex negotiations over gender, salvation, sanctity and Christology that we find in the writings of the Church fathers. The article provides some suggestions as to how we can understand the notion of the virgin Christ within the context of early Christian and late antique theological debates on the one hand, and in light of the growing interest in sacred virginity on the other.",Sissel,Undheim,,NO,University of Agder,sissel.undheim@uia.no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,Late Roman Empire; Early Christianity; Late Antiquity; Textual Studies; Historical Inquiry,,,BR60-67,text,"Religious Studies, History","virginity, sexuality, Christ, gender",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14908,10.1558/bsor.v41i2.22,2019-11-29 14:34:19,2019-11-29 15:06:26,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,
14911,"Divinity Manifest in a Female Body: Guglielma of Milan as the Holy Spirit, Female Deity and Female Leadership in the Later Middle Ages","The article investigates a medieval heretical group, the Guglielmites, who worshipped their founder Guglielma of Milan (d. 1281) as the Holy Spirit incarnate and expected another woman, Maifreda da Pirovano, to become pope, the vicar of the Holy Spirit, at Guglielma's second coming in the year 1300. This event was prevented, however, by Dominican inquisitors, but we know that Maifreda's priestly activities had been going on for years. The article argues that the theology and practice of the Guglielmites developed gradually on a background of mysticism, eschatological expectations, imitation of Christ, and Eucharistic devotion. However, contrary to much female godlanguage in the Middle Ages, which was symbolic, female divinity was seen as taking flesh in a woman, and for that reason also her vicar on earth had to be a woman.

14919,The Possibilities of Change in a World of Constraint: Individual and Social Transformation in the Work of Pierre Bourdieu,"In this essay I will suggest that the work of Pierre Bourdieu, a scholar whose work seldom focused on religion, offers tools for thinking about personal and social change that can aid us in understanding religious conversion and deconversion. In Bourdieu we find ways to conceptualize change that are materially grounded and embodied. As a post-structuralist, Bourdieu refuses to reduce individual change and stasis to the machinations of hardened social structures that stand apart from human activity. At the same time, Bourdieu is a social theorist who—in acknowledging the statistical regularities that demonstrate the reproduction of social inequalities—also avoids simplistic conceptions of human subjectivity that imagines autonomous individuals who possess some magical spark of free will to stand outside all external compulsions and rationally choose their life trajectories. For those interested in mapping the possibilities of change in a world of constraint, Bourdieu offers some useful starting points.",Sean,McCloud,,US,The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,spmcclou@uncc.edu,,"Sean McCloud is an Associate Professor of Religious Studies at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

When it comes to Bourdieu's specific work on religion and in particular his concept of the religious field, scholars have been less enthusiastic in particular in relation to religion in complex societies.

14922,"The Author, the Atheist, and the Academic Study of Religion: Bourdieu and the Reception of Biblical Criticism by Progressive Christians","Recently, there has been an upsurge in the publication of popular biblical criticisms, as exemplified by the popular works of scholars such as John Dominic Crossan, Marcus Borg, Bart Ehrman and the Jesus Seminar, as well as by theological thinkers such as Bishop John Shelby Spong. My paper draws upon two years of formal anthropological fieldwork conducted at five North American mainline liberal churches that feature reading and discussion groups involved in the study of biblical criticism at a lay or popular level. In offering an analysis of progressive Christianity that engages with the scholarly works of Pierre Bourdieu, I propose to do two things. First, I argue that the study of religion and biblical criticism by progressive Christians serves as an ideal venue in which they are able to construct, articulate and proudly assume an alternative, non-normative Christian identity. I suggest that this identity is one that is formed in opposition to an evangelical or fundamentalist representation of Christianity, which I term, following Jonathan Z. Smith, a ‘Protestant proximate other’ (Smith 2004: 253).",Rebekka,King,,CA,University of Toronto,rebekka.king@utoronto.ca,http://utoronto.academia.edu/RebekkaKing,"Rebekka King is a PhD Candidate at the Centre for the Study of Religion, University of Toronto, Canada.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,North America; Canada; contemporary; Participant/Observant,,,BR1615-1617,text,"Religious Studies, Sociology, Anthropology","Pierre Bourdieu, Progressive Christianity, Popular Religion",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14922,10.1558/bsor.v41i1.004,2019-11-29 15:46:26,2019-11-29 16:31:30,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,
14924,Prophets and Profits: On Economies of Economic Goods in Economies of Salvation,"Pierre Bourdieu suggested that religion is an example of what he called an ""economy of symbolic goods,"" a field of social practice governed by the logic of disinterestedness, in which successful participants must disavow self-interest and the pursuit of economic goods and profits. Bourdieu argued that within such economies, symbolic as well as economic profits can only be accrued through such strategies as refusals to calculate, taboos against making costs and values explicit, and choreographing of exchanges to make them appear discontinuous and gratuitous. This essay uses the New Testament writings of Paul and Protestant texts by the German Reformer Martin Luther and American Presbyterian William Speer, in each of which economic interests are openly expressed and economic strategies and values promoted, to suggest modifications to Bourdieu's understanding of how economies of symbolic goods and economies of economic goods are mutually defined and interrelate.",Kevin,Wanner,,US,Western Michigan University,kevin.wanner@wmich.edu,,"Kevin Wanner is Associate Professor of Comparative Religion at Western Michigan University, United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,Reformation; 19th century; Sociological analysis; Criticism of theory,,,"BR115, HM481-554",text,"Religious Studies, Sociology, Economics","Pierre Bourdieu, Economies of symbolic goods, Christianity, Protestantism",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14924,10.1558/bsor.v41i1.005,2019-11-29 15:52:34,2019-11-29 16:31:31,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

Though some panelists challenged this “religious” in hip hop, all agreed that hip hop is of theoretical and methodological import for African American religious studies and religious studies in general.

My investigation highlights the online dramatic form of ""machinima"" (machine-cinema) - a creative, often unintended user adaptation of video game engines and movie-making software. I argue that ‘swagger’, a collective of black cultural expressions that signify confidence, success, rhythmic body movements, and highly stylized appearance, is reconfigured by gamers for virtual environments, resulting in the creation of highly stylized virtual worlds, the modding (modifying) of simulated characters, and the re-composing of the game’s narrative architecture into player-created storylines.

14994,"Bishop Lamont and Hermeneutics of Play: Hip Hop, Religion, and the Study of American Religious History","This paper investigates the subject of hip-hop within the study of religion and the study of American religion and culture. In particular, the paper focuses on the corpus of California hip-hop artist Bishop Lamont in developing a ""hermeneutics of play"" through a combinative ""lived religion"" approach as a way of reading and reflecting on the larger religious significance of hip-hop in late 20th century America. As both a reading practice and a subject of study for both historians and religious studies scholars, hip-hop comes into view in this paper as an essential component in narrating an American religious history of the last three decades. Hip-hop and its study also reveals its own understandings of religion, America, and American religion as articulated through post-industrial and a variety of religious vocabularies that have been largely ignored by scholars of religion. In essence, this paper argues that by exploring the rhetorical, religious, and existential complexity found within hip-hop cultures, a more complex post-1965 American religious landscape emerges for both the historian and theorist of religion.",L.,Rolsky,,US,Drew University,lrolsky@drew.edu,,Rolsky is a first-year PhD student in the historical studies area within the Graduate Division of Religion at Drew University.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,North America; Contemporary; Post-World War II America; Historical inquiry; close reading; survey article,,,"BL1-50, BL2500-2592, BR140-1510, E838-889, F856-870",text,"Religious Studies, American Religious History, History","Hip-hop, rap, American religious history, theory of religion",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14994,10.1558/bsor.v40i3.003,2019-12-03 12:05:40,2019-12-03 12:42:43,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

14996,"Constructing 'The Day After': Goodie Mob, Exaggerated Radical Contingency and the Metaphysics of White Supremacy","Based out of Atlanta, GA, rap group Goodie Mob emerged in 1995 and gained critical and commercial success in large part through their ability to maintain a lyrical and musical balance between prophetically biting social commentaries concerning racism, poverty, violence, and sexism with an overtly theistic (and often Christian) metaphysical program responsive to these concerns. One way Goodie Mob maintains this balance is through the heuristic of death. Often, the group suggests death - the fear or exaggeration of it - is responsible for the individual and social sufferings that offer a starting platform for their prophetic critiques. At other times, death is deemed the only real solution to suffering. During these moments, death offers an end to suffering and the discovery of a response to the absurdity and arbitrariness of death and suffering. Using Goodie Mob's lyrics, this essay explores the relationship between metaphysical constructions and social injustices like white supremacy, and ultimately concludes that white supremacy might be thought of as a metaphysical system.",Christopher,Driscoll,,US,Rice University,chrisdriscoll@rice.edu,,Christopher Driscoll is a graduate student of Religious Studies at Rice University.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en_US,Contemporary; critical essay,,,"BL1-50, HT1501-1595",text,"Religious Studies, Ethnomusicology, Cultural Studies, Racial Studies","Goodie Mob, Radical Contingency, Charles Long, Metaphysics, Whiteness, White Supremacy",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/14996,10.1558/bsor.v40i3.005,2019-12-03 12:24:39,2019-12-03 12:42:45,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

Prothero asserts that this perspective is problematic because it is factually false, undercuts true religious and cultural diversity, and fails to diagnose the dynamics behind large-scale cultural phenomena. Yet in his attempt to discredit perennialism Prothero provides the reader a portrayal of religion that is perennialist in nature: he portrays religion as a ""sacred"" and ""transcendent"" essence; he asserts that unpopular religious phenomena are political rather than religious; and he locates unifying similarities across a wide variety of religious phenomena in a way that is methodologically problematic.

Specifically, I discuss the issues of defining religion, the history of the category ""religion,"" and the relationship between that category and Euro-American colonialism. The central argument offered is that Prothero's implicit theory of religion is poorly defined, uninformed about the history of the term, and naive about issues of cross-cultural study. As such, his picture of religion is ethnocentric in that, for all his discussion of differences, he does not see real difference.

15052,The Benefit of Blogging for Archaeology,"Blogging (or “web logging”) has evolved from online journaling to a multi-million dollar enterprise involving over 100 million blogs worldwide. And while journalists and news organizations have been quick to adopt blogging as a publishing tool, the academy has been slow to adopt the technology as a legitimate scholarly enterprise. This article argues that blogging is the next logical step for independent scholars and researchers who seek to publish their original work, and that universities should begin accepting blogging as a legitimate scholarly endeavor. Specifically, archaeologists should embrace blogging because of its ease of use, decreased time to publication, affordability, ability to publish multiple forms of media, and for the increased exposure publishing online brings to a scholar’s work.

The questions I am interested in are: what is the main Jaina value or values according to my interviewees? In particular, what is the place and status of ahimsa (nonviolence) among contemporary notions of value, and is ahimsa repositioned or redefined in the contemporary context? Do Jaina values impact the social sphere and if so, how? In what ways does a particular form of conduct result as a consequence of those values? What does this say about the ways contemporary Indian lay Jainas imagine society? In analyzing the positions of my interviewees, I note similarities to and differences from the position of a group of Terapanthi nuns, whom I also interviewed. By means of my ethnographic material, I demonstrate that Jaina normative moral theory, though rooted in ahimsa, nevertheless exhibits flexibility based on individual and socio-historical contexts.",Tomasz,Pokinko,,CA,"McGill University, Montreal",tomasz.pokinko@mail.mcgill.ca,,"Faculty of Religious Studies PhD Candidate (Religious Ethics, Hindu & Jaina Ethics)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jainism in Focus,en_US,India; contemporary; 20-60 years of age; male and female; Indian lay Jainas; Interview; historical analysis,,,"Jainism BL1300-1380, Religious Ethics BJ1188-1295",text,"Religious Studies, Sociology","Tomasz Pokinko, Jainism, Ethics, Ahimsa, Jaina values, Terapanthi, Jaipur, Delhi",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/15058,10.1558/bsor.v39i2.004,2019-12-04 13:03:10,2019-12-04 14:11:01,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

Preksha is a system of yoga and meditation introduced by Acarya Mahaprajna of the Jain Svetambara Terapanth in the late twentieth century. I argue that preksha is an attempt to join the newly emerging transnational yoga market whereby yoga has become a practice oriented around the attainment of physical health and psychological well-being. I will evaluate the ways in which Mahaprajna appropriates scientific discourse and in so doing constructs a new and unique system of Jain modern yoga. In particular, I evaluate the appropriation of physical and meditative techniques from ancient yoga systems in addition to the explanation of yoga metaphysics by means of biomedical discourse. I will demonstrate how, in Mahaprajna’s preksha system, the metaphysical subtle body becomes somaticized. In other words, Mahaprajna uses the bio-medical understanding of physiology to locate and identify the functions of metaphysical subtle body parts and processes in the physiological body.",Andrea,Jain,,US,,andreajain@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jainism in Focus,en_US,Ethnographic,,,South Asian Religions,text,Religious Studies,"Jain, Modern Yoga",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/15059,10.1558/bsor.v39i2.005,2019-12-04 13:10:36,2019-12-04 14:11:02,Daniel,Gronow,,dgronow@equinoxpub.com,,,,,,,,

17818,A  History of the Study of Apocrypha in Early Medieval England,"Literature written in England between about 500 and 1100 CE attests to a wide range of traditions, although it is clear that Christian sources were the most influential. Biblical apocrypha feature prominently across this corpus of literature, as early English authors clearly relied on a range of extra-biblical texts and traditions related to works under the umbrella of what have been called “Old Testament Pseudepigrapha” and “New Testament/Christian Apocrypha."" While scholars of pseudepigrapha and apocrypha have long trained their eyes upon literature from the first few centuries of early Judaism and early Christianity, the medieval period has much to offer. This article presents a survey of significant developments and key threads in the history of scholarship on apocrypha in early medieval England. My purpose is not to offer a comprehensive bibliography, but to highlight major studies that have focused on the transmission of specific apocrypha, contributed to knowledge about medieval uses of apocrypha, and shaped the field from the nineteenth century up to the present.

It first stresses a necessity to accurately define Apocrypha and saints’ lives within early Christian literature. The transmission of Apocrypha and saints’ lives in their textual varieties, the number of manuscripts they appear in, and their absence of authorship also demand further discussion. Scholars additionally do not reach the consensus over their readership, reputation, and audience in the same period. 
 Although a great deal of potential remains in these genres for the pursuances named above, one has to bear in mind the restrictions. One has to be cautious when prying out social realities from hagiography. One also has to distinguish the theological and religious aspects from the social realities and realities of everyday life in such texts, as well as to pay attention to their literary and genre aspects.

He has published an array of journal articles, book chapters and online essays. His book, Identifying Roots: Alex Haley and the Anthropology of Scriptures (Equinox 2020), casts Alex Haley’s Roots as a case study in the dynamics of scriptures and identity politics with critical implication for the study of race, religion, and media. He is also the curator of the  multimedia professional development network, Sowing the Seed: Fruitful Conversations in Religion, Culture, and Teaching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Interview,en_US,North America,,,"Jewish Studies, religion, graduate school, publishing, religious studies, biblical studies","text, interview","religious studies, biblical studies, jewish studies","Ancient Jew Review, Jewish Studies, religious studies, biblical studies, academia",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/20027,10.1558/bsor.20027,2021-04-28 17:49:27,2021-04-28 17:49:27,Richard,Newton,,rwnewton@ua.edu,,,,,,,,
20028,Can You Show Me a Less Painful Way to Grade?,"In the Bulletin’s advice column, Sage D’Vice addresses questions and concerns from readers while providing insightful and thoughtful advice. This issue, Sage D’Vice responds to a submission addressing a professor’s least favorite part of the job—grading. The response begins with a conversation about understanding what grading is, a look at how different assignments require different kinds of grading, and the reminder that a professor need only grade the assignments they assign. A lighthearted and fun discussion about the part of the job that consumes a significant amount of time (especially at the end of a semester), Sage D’Vice provides practical and thoughtful advice on what it means to grade smarter, not harder.",Richard,Newton,,US,,rwnewton@ua.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Question,en_US,North America,,,"grading, teaching, higher education, religious studies",text,"religious studies, pedagogy","pedagogy, grading, religious studies, lms, productivity",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/20028,10.1558/bsor.20028,2021-04-28 18:13:25,2021-04-28 18:13:25,Richard,Newton,,rwnewton@ua.edu,,,,,,,,
20029,From Essence to Queery—Puzzling Over the Persistence of Identity,"The following conversation between K. Merinda Simmons (University of Alabama) and Jeremy Posadas (Austin College) is an outgrowth of a roundtable on class, identity, and religion presented as part of the North American Association for the Study of Religion (NAASR) meeting in November 2020. That discussion reflected participants’ respective approaches and research emphases, of course, but we all in one way or another focused our comments on the role of intersectionality (i.e., the approach to identity that sees social categories and systems of discrimination as structurally interconnected) within the academic study of religion. Using that theme as a starting point, the back-and-forth that follows brings our respective work in gender studies and queer theory into the mix. While exchanging the messages that became this text, we purposefully took an approach of “thinking out loud” and experimenting with ideas in formative stages. This embrace of what remains unsettled—in fact, the process of unsettling what scholars often take to be terra firma—is reflected in our tone and in our relative disinterest in structural linearity. We hope instead that this conversation might be read as exactly that: a conversation, necessarily partial and productively unfinished.",K.

20030,The Future of Museum Studies with Dr. Nicholaus Pumphrey,"“The Profession” opens a window onto the myriad ways scholars have made use of their training in and beyond the academy. In this issue, editorial assistant Emma Welch speaks with Dr. Nicholaus Pumphrey—curator of the Quayle Bible Collection at Baker University—looking into the discourse on museums and archives and the questions it brings for the scholar of religion.

20033,Leading Works in Religion and Law: A Fictional Volume Inspired by Leading Works in Law and Religion,"“The Experiment” presents scholars of religion with an opportunity to draw upon their training to reflect upon a contemporary issue. Editorial assistant Jacob Barrett engages with a recent edited volume from Routledge titled Leading Works in Law and Religion that, while focusing on the identity of the subfield of law and religion within the discipline of legal studies in the United Kingdom and Ireland, provides many sites for comparison with the religion and law subfield of religious studies in the United States context. Drawing upon the model set by the volume, Barrett imagines what a volume titled Leading Works in Religion and Law could look like and what the subfield of religion and law stands to gain from engaging in a project like the one done by its law and religion counterpart.",Jacob,Barrett,,US,University of Alabama,jbarrett4@crimson.ua.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Experiment,en_US,"United Kingdom and Ireland, United States",,,Religious Studies,Text,"Religious Studies, Legal Studies","Religion and Law, Religious Freedom, Legal Studies, The Experiment",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/20033,10.1558/bsor.20033,2021-04-30 02:13:00,2021-04-30 02:13:00,Richard,Newton,,rwnewton@ua.edu,,,,,,,,

20125,Underdogs and Englishmen—Diana and the Secular Worship of the Nation,"In “The Archive” we republish articles that, in hindsight, may have been ahead of their time in its prescience. Our pull for this issue is a 1997 piece from Stephen Heathorn originally written in the wake of the death of Princess Diana. Drawing on the outpouring of emotion displayed worldwide following Diana’s death, Heathorn discusses the role royal mythmaking plays in the maintenance of British nationalism and policing of British identity during a time of declining British imperialism. Through an engaging and exciting piece of scholarship that discusses one of the world’s most beloved public figures, Heathorn encourages a critical, sociopolitical interrogation of the myths we may not even realize we subscribe to.",Stephen,Heathorn,,CA,McMaster University,heaths@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Archive,en_US,Global,,,religious studies,Text,Religious Studies,"Princess Diana, Worship, Nation, United Kingdom",,Published,https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSOR/workflow/access/20125,10.1558/bsor.20125,2021-05-11 15:18:14,2021-05-11 15:18:14,Richard,Newton,,rwnewton@ua.edu,Dave,Doyle,,contact@davedoyle.co.uk,,,,
